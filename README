the core twiCal wrappers will now be available this project is dependent on the github twitteroauth project + a php vcalendar library.

Will expand and add more details shortly.

The files within this library will contain the core twical wrapper to the vcal calss and wrappers for working with twitteroauth.

The key componenets within this project will be the callback from twitter - storage of token details in a mysql db - using PEAR MDB2 - so any DB could be used. The upload of an ics or a webcal file, and the storage of that data with conversion of local time entries to GMT.

There will also be code for basic tweet out mechanisms.


Local ini should be outside of the webroot.
